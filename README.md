[kmapper.org](https://kmapper.org) uses the [works endpoint](https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/works) of the [OpenAlex API](https://docs.openalex.org/) to search for gold open access articles.
It also visualizes the relevant Sustainable Development Goals and research domains assigned to the search results by OpenAlex.

This is an ongoing experiment and I welcome your feedback.
