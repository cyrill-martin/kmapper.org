      kmapper.org leverages the
      <a href="https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/works" target="_blank">OpenAlex API</a> to map
      connections within open access research. It visualizes how the resulting literature from your
      search relates to relevant
      <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals" target="_blank">Sustainable Development Goals</a> and
      various research fields, providing a contextual overview of interdisciplinary relationships.
      Furthermore, the interactive visualization allows you to browse the body of literature from
      the perspective of individual articles, research fields, or SDGs. This visual mapping can
      serve as a foundation for crafting stories that bridge different scientific fields.
